        <h3>What is Sigiriya?</h3>
        <p>
          Sigiriya, often referred to as the “Eighth Wonder of the World,” is a 200-meter-high rock fortress located in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka.
          It was built in the 5th century AD by King Kashyapa as both a royal residence and a stronghold.

        <h3>Architectural Marvel</h3>
        <p>
          Sigiriya features advanced ancient urban planning, complete with water gardens, moats, ramparts, and an intricate drainage system that still functions today.
          The frescoes painted on the rock walls and the mirror wall polished to such a shine it reflected the king’s image, are testament to the creativity and skill of ancient Sri Lankan artists and engineers.

        <h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
        <p>
          Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, Sigiriya continues to captivate historians, tourists, and archaeologists.
          Its blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and archaeological value makes it one of the most important landmarks in Sri Lanka.
